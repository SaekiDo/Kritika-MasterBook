? Intro
-------
Hello, I'm Saeki and I run the guild named [Noir] on the [NA] Kritika Online server. I wanted to make a better discriptive help guide for the newer or returning players out there. Since a lot of the information in game is very vauge for most players, and more times than not become confused and uncertain of what specific functions and items allow them to do. So with that I've decided to make a in-depth guide explaining items, features, and functions that are in the game. I took inspiration from the former "Master Book" located in the directory files and decided to update and re-create what already existed in it. Hopefully this will help out some people that have questions about things in game.
--------
? Salvage
--------
The [Salvage Machine] allows you to discard un-wanted equipment in exchange for useful materials that might help you out with crafting more powerful equipment or items. Items can be sorted into five categories: [Inferior],[Average],[Superior],[Rare],and [Legendary] you can also select the [All] tab to clear everything in your equipment tab. Though do be careful when selecting this since you could delete some potientialy useful equipment! Early on while leveling your character it's better to [Salvage] items you don't need since selling will only give you about 1 gold per sale. Most times, [Salvage Machine(s)] can be found in towns towards the merchants or near the [Danger Zone Highways]. After completing danger zones [Youla] will appear to help you out with grinding down un-wanted equipment or sell things you no longer have a need for. If you have the [King Piglet] pet you can also spawn your own personal salvaging merchant with some extra goodies thrown in. 
--------------
? Class Change
-------------
When first creating your character you have a an vauge overview of the potential classes that you'll be able to advance into (This prompt will show up again around Lv5~10 to remind you again of the choices). Once you are level 15, an exclimation prompt will appear above your skill bars which will inturn allow you to pick a class to advance into. When you select the class you will be teleported to the class change area (Names of the area differ from classes.) There will most times a class master will show you a brief overview of skills for each class and eventually allow you to pick the class you'd like to pregress forward with. (There aren't any class change reverts to be sure with your choice!) Once set and stone with your decision you'll have a whole new arseneal of skills to choose from. (Your Apperence, Idle poses, Portraits ,and SP gauges (depending on the class.) will also change as well.) You will also receive your [Prime Attribute Stat] at this point too.
--------------
Awakening
--------------
At Lv50 you'll be able to apply for your First Awakening through [Tuval] in [Opportunity Bay]. He'll give you the basic run down of what it does but, just in case once you complete your awakening you'll have access to three new enhanced [EX]-Styled skills that when activating ([Tab] by default) will put you in [EX-Mode] Giving you an temperory damage buff and access to use these enhanced skills (Eclair exempt she has her own special type of [Tab] Skill.) You also unlock awakening passives to prior skills that will increase their effeicency depending on the amount of points invested into them. 

Also at Lv70 once completing the Windhome Storyline. [Lael] will have a Second Awakening storyline for you to follow. (At the current time of this guide, [Gunmage] does not have an Second Awakening as of yet.) Each class/job will have it's own path of quests it'll have to complete to become awakened. Ranging from collecting items or exchanging materials to obtain something, It'll vary to each class. After you complete all the objectives and advance to your newly found class, You'll have access to 6 new skills (5 actives and 1 passive.) You'll also gain a new portait,idle pose, And prefex [Noble] to go with it! Lastly after everything is said and done, [Lael] will have one last request to give which comes with a unique class title specific to your advancement. 
--------------
? Intrusion
----------
Starting from the [Fountain Square Danger Zone Highway] up to the [Xanadu Danger Zone Highway] you can trigger [Intrusions] with powerful foes that will inturpt your normal danger zone. These encounters are normally random but, if you gather x10 [Certain Challenge Letter(s)] You can trigger an [Intrusion] to be able to fight these NPCS. These fights will consist of 1~3 Star NPC Bosses that will drop quite handy rewards if you manage to beat them. The higher the star, the more plentiful the loot will be. These loots range from [Epiphiny(s)], [Fix-it Hammer(s)], [Reappraisal Scroll(s)], to even [Kagerfeld Badge(s)]. So keep a look out for the [Intrusion] warnings in your runs! Be warned though some of the fights can be pretty tough so, maybe take a party member or two with to help out with the fight. 
--------------------
Danger Zone Highway
---------
Danger zones are the main source of gaining EXP and grinding for those precious gears and gold. Most if not all zones will have four difficultys ranging from [Easy],[Normal],[Hard], Or [Extreme/Insane] depending on this choice you will earn a certain amount of EXP, Drops, and Gold. I'll list the rates below as well. Keep in mind Running through these danger zones will consume Rest Points [RP] Which depending on the amount will give you extra rewards during the dungeon Ranging from Monster and Zone clear EXP to Gold and Item drops. You are given a max amount of 300 [RP] 330[RP] for [Elite Status Membership] this can be refilled with various items like [Delicious Berry Pie(s)] or [Large Refreshing Beverage(s)]

[Easy]: Drops+0, Gold Rate x1, EXP x1 
[Normal]: Drops +1, Gold Rate x1.5, EXP x4
[Hard]: Drops +2, Gold Rate x2, EXP x6
[Extreme]: Drops +2, Gold Rate x2.5, EXP x8

While in the Danger Zone Highway menu,There are special tabs ranging from [Ultimate Zones],[Normal Zones],[Action Danger Zones],[Dailies],[Events],[Arena],and [Imprinting]. All of these areas are accessable from the [Danger Zone Highway]. ([Action Zones] and [Ultimate Zones] are only accessable through certain level highways). You can examine the "Best Possible Loot" as well as the basic information about an danger zone by simply clicking the portrait and bringing up an detailed box with more information. This information will include The reccomended Combat Rating [CR], Party Size,and the amount of areas and rest points used. Later on this will help you figure out which zones you'll need to be farming for certain equipment and gear. 
---------
Ultimate Zones
---------------
Ultimate Zones are the end game Danger Zones of the game. These dungeons withhold extremely useful gear that more times than not, can greatly boost your characters offensive and defensive stats. The [Ultimate Zone(s)] can be accessed through the [Danger Zone Highway] menu. These zones are no walk through the park though, they call for very high Combat Rating [CR] and are usually for the more skilled players. Don't fret though, you can usually pay a higher geared player to help you through the runs. But, if you're not for that you can always team up with friends or guildmembers and try and take them down that way as well. take note that [Ultimate Zone(s)] have a max shared ressurction limit of 5 for the entire party so it's best to do these with a coordinated team if you're planning to do a party run of these zones. 

In our version as of now only has five [Ultimate Zone(s)] I'll list them down below with reccomended Combat Ratings [CR]. Most of these ratings aren't fair representation of the actual difficulty though, Since it'll range from class to class some needing only the recommended while others needing 200~500k+ more Combat rating [CR] to be able to clear the zones.

[Shattered Table]: 200,000 [CR]
[Titan's Rage]: 200,000 [CR]
[Skyship Arcadia: Central Deck]: 300,000 [CR]
[Eeri's Library]: 1,250,000 [CR]
[[Dusk] Pirates' Den]: 1,850,000 [CR]
---------------
Crafting
---------
Crafting offers you a plethora of items varying from [Equipment], [Charms], [Power Cores], [Consumeables] ,and [Materials] you may need to further your character progression. You may need specific materials or gold to complete certain crafts. Most of these items will come from [Ultimate Zone(s)] or [Danger Zone(s)]. You may also gain crafting materials from the [Salvage Machine] after salvaging unwanted equipment. These materials could become an essential part of your next crafting project so be sure to store them. You can track the progress of your crafts by clicking the [Memo] box and checking it. This will add the item to your quest tab under [Memo] and allow you to keep track of the items needed left to craft an item.
---------
? Guilds
-------
Guilds in Kritika offer a great source of support and company when you're tired of playing alone in-game. If you're looking to join or create a guild look no further! By pressing the guild key (Default [U].) It'll bring up the guild menu where you can look for guilds that are recruiting, Or you may also create an guild of your own. Applying to a current guild is relativly easy. While in the guild menu look for a guild you'd like to join and click the [Apply] button. You're able to add a short message to be reviewed for your application as well so, maybe write a nice message to your potential new guildmates. If you are looking to create your own guild it'll cost you 100,000 Gold and require you to be Lv15. After that name your guild and you're ready to go. Add friends, recruit new guild members ,and hopefully create a nice community for yourself. 

While in a guild there are certain ranks to one as well ranging from [Guildleader], [Officer] ,and [Member]. Positions can be changed by the [Guildmaster] depending on how they want to build the guild. [Guildleader(s)] can also give titles to guildmembers up to 8 characters, It makes for a unique experience in guild communities. You can also add personal memos to guildmembers to make a note of whatever the case might be. To do this just click the guildmember you'd like to add a memo to and create your memo and confirm. 

Guild's also provide a [Guild Item Shop] that allows you to buy an assortment of items depending on the guilds level. These items are anything from [Gigaphone(s)], Half-hour potion buffs, 3-Hour potion buffs, and power core support items. Guild points can be obtained by running through [Danger Zones], Helping guild members through [Danger Zones], extending [Guild Skills] and logging in daily.

[Guildleader(s)] can select guild skills they'd like to have benifit their guild members as well. These passive stats aare a nice bonus if you level them up to their full potentials. I'l list the skill information down below.

[Strike as One]: +Attack Power
[Stand Together]: +Defence
[Blood Brothers]: +Max HP/SP
[Bro Code]: +Accuracy/Evasion

If you ever decide to disband your guild, You'll have to kick everyone from the guild first and properly disband the guild. You can also transfer the [Guildleader] role over to another member if you feel it's the right decision as well.
-------
? Friends
--------
Making friends is a given in any game you play online. By pressing "[" (Default key) you're able to access your friends list where you can check Combat ratings [CR], Combo Scores, and any new Friend requests made to your character. You can also add nicknames to your friends by clicking the "Pen & Paper" icon to add a memo to that friend. Kritika allows you to send Friend Points [FP] to five friends daily. These points can be used in the Gift store to nab some extra items ranging from [Fix-it Hammer(s)] to [Kagerfeld Badge(s)] these are items that'll give that extra little push to your experience. You can also blacklist players for whatever reason this may be you can add players to this list by right clicking the character name or Player and selecting "Block Friend" if you ever decide to change your mind about this you can Right click again and select "Un-blacklist" to undo the action. 
-----------------------
Appearence Change
---------------------
Don't like your look? No worries! You can pick up an [Apperence Change Voucher] From [NPC Scar], [EMP Shop] ,or simply picking one up from the [Auction House]. This item will allow you to change your character to your liking (All costume items will be hidden during this change.) Once you accept the changes, You won't be able to change it again until you get your hands on a new voucher so be sure of your decisions.
-------------------
? Artifacts
----------
Artifacts are another type of equipment you can enhance to further boost your character stats. Artifacts can be found in certain dungeons (Ex. Luciana's Pavilion and Invasion Point). These items can be dragged to a hot key to activate a special ability bound to the artifact that usually has a cooldown of 3 minutes depending on the artifact it'll cost a certain amount of Kritium shard. The first artifact you'll most likely have your hands on is called the [Vindon Kugelblitz] It's a very nice starter artifact that boosts your Combat Rating [CR] by a nice chunk, especially so when you enhance and evolve it. Do be careful though, Even though equipment doesn't break on enhancment; artifacts can break past +3 if you fail to enhance up so keep that in mind. [Superior Artifact Crate(s)] can also be obtained by exchanging [Violet Boss Soul(s)] through [Ceurulean] in Starhenge or [Philo] in Windhome. With these crates you can fuse [Superior] grade artifacts up to [Legendary] grade if you don't have the [Artifact Evo Rune(s)] to craft Vindons to fuse and want to use souls instead. There's an whole list of artifacts you can check out by hitting the [Item Combine] icon and looking at the [Combination Results]. Play with them until you find one that works best for you. 

Here's a list of artifacts that I highly recommend aiming for when combining artifacts together. (Keep in mind these are the legendary variants.)
-Jahulant Assault Shard
-Jahulant Power Shard
-Jahulant True Shard <-- (This is the one you want to aim for the most out of them all.) 
----------
K-Perks 
--------------
K-Perks is a boost-type system Kritika rewards characters for using Rest Points [RP]. Holding your cursor over the "K-Perks" Buff icon will display your current progress into the K-perks buff. This buff can become pretty handy if you're having trouble on certain bosses or areas and need the extra kick of damage to help out. You'll gain damage related tier buffs depending on the amount of RP you've consumed for the day. Note that the buff will only add up if you are doing level appropriate danger zones and will reset daily. (If this is your first character you'll have to level a character to 65 before you'll be able to work towards these buffs.)
--------
PvP
----
The PvP Arena is a area where players can hone their skills and fight friends or other players (Default key [P]). PvP in Kritika Online currently has four playmodes; Dead or Alive, Team Battle, Capture the Flag, and Avatar War. Each battle type has it's own play style. While fighting (Ranked matches) you can obtain medals that are able to be exchanged for rewards from NPC Scar. While in the PvP lobby you are also allowed to observe other matches (Friendly Matches) There's a section in the room where you can observe only or be next in line to show them what you're made of.

Dead or Alive: A 1v1 rounded battle type where each player fights to score kills. First to set amount wins.
Team Battle: A 2v2 or 3v3 rounded battle type that turns into a bout the opposite team will fight each other until one falls and replaced with another team member until one is victorious.

[Action Zone(s)] are special zones that you are allowed to completed twice a day (Per character). These danger zones drop rewards from [Etherstone(s)] to [Action Coin(s)] to unique timed titles. While in this zone your Combat Rating [CR] will be calibrated depending on the stats of your character and/or your partner (Max party limit 2 people 2/2). These special zones are accessable through the [Xanadu] and [Windhome Danger Zone Highway(s)]. 
------------------
Prime Attribute
----------------
Prime attributes are a essential to building your character, You are given an attribute after your Job Change at Lv15, Depending on the class you will be given one of the three attributes (Resolve, Finesse, or Will) But, you tend to forget about it since, you don't obtain gear with attributes until level 70. Keep this detail on the back burner since it'll help you out in the long run. [Attribute Change Stone(s)] allow you to randomly change the Prime attribute of a specific equipment peice) Once you obtain prime attribute equipment be it Weapons, Armor, or Accessories you will start to accumilate "Prime Attribute Points" depending on the enhancement level of the armor or accessory. (Weapons keep the same 49 point no matter the enhancement level.) These points will boost the damage of your character and also start building towards the "Prime Attribute Level" of your character. Prime levels have tiers Lv.1~5 depending on the amount of points (Lv.1 starting at 200.) You unlock special properties for the class once these tiers are hit. Anything from Cooldowns to attack boosts are availible from these. You can also obtain [Prime Attribute Point(s)] from special Emblems or accents as well. These will help you along if you're missing that sliver from hitting your next tier. 
----------------------
Power Core
------------
[Power Core(s)] are equipment peices that once charged with [Blue Kritium Shard(s)] can be in-turn used to deal extra bits of damage with each attack you do. Starting at Lv.60 Cerulean will introduce you to the [Power Core] mechanic and give you your very first [Power Core III]. Keep in mind that [Power Core(s)] don't last forever, every grade power core has a different charge amount and costs a different amount of [Blue Kritium Shard] to be charged. [Power Core(s)] range from [Superior] to [Legendary] grades and have a variety of different effects among the types. Once the core is depleted of all it's charges it will be unuseable and you can salvage it for [Cracked Power Core(s)] these can be used to craft more powerful [Power Core(s)] or be traded into [Mouri] for [Power Core Box(es)].

To get started talk to [Maril] at the [Fractured Memories Gate] while talking to her, she'll have a few options but we'll start by explaining [Fractured Memories] more in-depth first. This mode consists of randomly generated maps that host different level monsters depending on the level of the floor. There currently exist 190 floors inside [Fractured Memories]. The level of the monsters will match the floor you're attempting (Ex. Floor 130: Monster Lv.130). While inside you'll be timed through out your run.

If you fail to clear in time you'll be stuck on the floor until you can pass under the time limit. Clearing these floors will grant you 3 ability points and Failing will only grant you 1 point. These can be spent on [Fractured Memories] passive abilitys that will benifit you greatly. There are three categories of skills [Offensive], [Defensive], and [Utility] abilitys. There will be a list of 3 recommended from each category down below but there are well over 3 in each category.

[Offensive]                                                   [Defensive]                                                       [Utility]

Devotion
-------------------
[Devotion] is a system within Kritika that will provide you with bonus stats for making multiple characters. To start select the [Devotion] tab from your [Inventory] to bring up the [Devotion] menu. This system has a maximum of five [Devotion] tiers you can start leveling this after any character acheives Lv.40. After this point your [Devotion] progress bar will slowly level up as you level your character. This function is very handy when you want to make other characters but feel leveling takes a bit too long.
------------------
Delivery
-------
The [Delivery] tab is where you'll obtain items received from the [Attendance Calender], [Daily Deals], [Events], [EMP Store] or codes redeemed through the [En Masse Launcher]. To access this open your [Inventory] (Default Key [I]) and select the [Delivery] tab. Here you'll be able to browse through the different tabes in your [Delivery Box] as well. If you are sent something or purchase an item from the [EMP Store] you will be notifyed a notification that appears on your screen.

Recalculation/Reappraising
---------------
[Recalculating]/[Reappraising] can be done by obtaining [Recalculation Scroll(s)] or [Reappraisal Scroll(s) from various [Merchants] or [Danger Zone(s)]. To start [Recalculating] or [Reappraising] Right-click either of the scroll items to bring up the [Scroll Cursor Icon] while in this, You can select any equipment peice you'd like to [Recalculate]or [Reappraise]. Starting out with [Reappraising], this will bring up the [Item Recalculation] menu while here you have an overview of the currently applyed to each [Appraised] stat on your equipment peice. You can simply recalculate the values of these by pressing the [Recalculate Item] button or by pressing [Enter]. This will change all of the values of the currently [Appraised] stats on the equipment. If you would like to keep a value of any of the stats, You can select the [Lock] icon of any of the the stats you'd like to keep values of. Keep in mind doing this will double the amount of [Recalculation Scroll(s)] you will be needed to provide for each [Recalculation] The max values of each stat is displayed at the right side of each stat bar. Once you are comfterable with the changes select the [Recalculation Changes] button to apply the changes. [Note: The changes will NOT be applied if you don't apply the changes.]  [Reappraising] is very similar to [Recalculating] items instead you are able to change the stat rather than thee values of the stats. While in the [Reappraisal] menu, hovering over the [Magnifying Glass] icon will tell you all of the stats that are able to be added to each equipment part. Down below is the recommended stats for each part. Priority will be listed in numerical order from which should be obtained first. (These can be changed up depending on your prefered playstyle.)
